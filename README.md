# Feedback for TA
1. hw1: -2: Footer is not at the bottom of the page.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
2. hw2: -3: When the input field receives focus, the info message should be shown. The submission shows an info message only when the input field receives focus and is valid and not empty.
3. hw-4: -2: Output is not a valid JSON. You have added "<br>" tag to it which is an HTML code construct.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
4. hw5: -5: No image is displayed for a video.﻿
5. pw-2: Kindly follow naming conventions for submissions.
-3: Event handler for onclick event was to be used.﻿﻿﻿﻿
-5: The CSS class name of the tag showing validation messages was supposed to be changed. The submission changes the property of element style.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
